## What is a Tool?

Per FPF: A **tool** is an artifact (physical or digital) that enables or facilitates the performance of a method. Tools are used; methods are performed.

A tool is NOT:
- A method (tools support methods)
- A work product (work products are outputs; tools are enablers)
- A skill (skills are in the agent; tools are external)
