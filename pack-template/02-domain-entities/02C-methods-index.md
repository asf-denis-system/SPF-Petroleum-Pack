## What is a Method?

Per FPF: A **method** (or practice) is a repeatable way of doing something that produces a predictable kind of result. Methods are performed by roles and produce work products.

A method is NOT:
- A tool (tools enable methods)
- A step-by-step scenario (that's an instance/application of a method)
- A work product (that's what the method produces)
