## What is an Object of Attention?

Objects of attention are the entities, states, or phenomena that practitioners observe, measure, or manipulate. They are NOT methods (what you do) but rather what you focus on while doing it.

Examples:
- A doctor attends to: vital signs, symptoms, patient history
- A project manager attends to: deadlines, dependencies, stakeholder concerns
- An engineer attends to: system states, error logs, performance metrics
