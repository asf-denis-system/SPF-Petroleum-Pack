# Process Lint Protocol

## What This Is

Process lint is a **mandatory verification protocol** applied to every change in `/pack/`. It is NOT a process stage — it is a cross-cutting quality gate that runs:

| Application Point | Who Runs | When |
|-------------------|----------|------|
| **Pre-commit** | Author (human or AI) | Before `git commit` |
| **Review** | Reviewer | During PR review |
| **Agent work** | AI agent | After each pack modification |

Process lint ensures that changes comply with the SPF constitution before they enter the repository.

## Change-Type Matrix

Each type of change triggers specific lint checks. Identify your change type(s) and verify all required items.

### CT-1: Method Card Added/Modified

File pattern: `/pack/<domain>/03-methods/*.md`

| Check | Verification |
|-------|--------------|
| **L-M01** | Definition describes WHAT, not HOW (no numbered steps) |
| **L-M02** | Inputs section is filled |
| **L-M03** | Outputs section links to work product(s) |
| **L-M04** | At least one distinction is referenced |
| **L-M05** | Failure modes are referenced |
| **L-M06** | SoTA status is assigned with revision criterion |
| **L-M07** | ID follows convention `<DOMAIN>.METHOD.<NNN>` |
| **L-M08** | Entry added to `02C-methods-index.md` |
| **L-M09** | Map updated in `07-map/` |
| **L-M10** | No didactic language (see [Universal Bans](#universal-bans)) |

### CT-2: Work Product Added/Modified

File pattern: `/pack/<domain>/04-work-products/*.md`

Any addition, removal, or relationship change.

| **L-STR02** | Affected indexes are updated |
| **L-STR03** | Cross-references in affected files are valid |

## Universal Bans

These apply to ALL changes. Any violation is a hard fail.

### UB-1: No Didactic Language

**FORBIDDEN** words/phrases in pack content:

| Forbidden | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| "step", "Step 1", "steps" | Scenarios belong downstream |
| "lesson", "module" | Learning design belongs downstream |
| "in N days", "week 1" | Temporal programs belong downstream |
| "implement", "try this" | Imperatives belong downstream |
| "first/then", "next" | Sequences belong downstream |
| "exercise", "practice this" | Activities belong downstream |

**Test**: Could this sentence appear in a course syllabus? If yes, rewrite.

### UB-2: No "Domain as System"

**FORBIDDEN**:
- "Personal development is a system"
- "The system of time management"
- Any claim that a domain IS a system (without specifying which system)

**Allowed**:
- "A person using method X can be modeled as a system"
- "The practice of Y involves these system boundaries"

### UB-3: No Method/Tool/Product Confusion

Every pack file must respect:

| Entity | Is | Is NOT |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Method | Way of acting | Tool, artifact, scenario |
| Tool | Artifact that supports method | Method itself |
| Work Product | Observable artifact | Description, feeling, intention |

**Test**: Apply [D.001](/pack/personal-development/01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d001-method-vs-tool) and [D.005](/pack/personal-development/01-domain-contract/01B-distinctions.md#d005-work-product-vs-description).

### UB-4: No Information-as-Knowledge

**FORBIDDEN**:
- Copying text from sources into pack files
- Using source's terminology without mapping to domain distinctions
- Treating "I read this" as "this is true"

**Required**:
- Information → Analysis (Stage 06) → Candidates → Extraction → Pack

## Process Compliance Mini-Checklist

Before committing ANY change to `/pack/`:

### Context
- [ ] **Bounded context exists**: `00-pack-manifest.md` has explicit scope
- [ ] **Change is within scope**: This change belongs in this pack

### Distinctions
- [ ] **Distinctions cover change**: No undefined concepts introduced
- [ ] **Distinction tests exist**: Can operationally distinguish terms used

### Content
- [ ] **SoTA assigned or N/A**: Status with revision criterion, or documented why not needed
- [ ] **No universal ban violations**: Checked UB-1 through UB-4

### Structure
- [ ] **Map updated**: Changes reflected in `07-map/`
- [ ] **IDs stable and valid**: Follow convention, not reused
- [ ] **Links resolve**: All cross-references work

### Process
- [ ] **Change-type identified**: Know which CT-* applies
- [ ] **CT-specific checks passed**: All items for that change type verified

| **HG-1** | Method added without work product link | Add WP or link to existing |
| **HG-2** | Method added without distinction reference | Add distinction link |
| **HG-3** | Work product without existence criteria | Add criteria |
| **HG-4** | Failure mode without detection test | Add test |
| **HG-5** | Structural change without map update | Update map |

## Integration Points

### For Humans
- Run lint checks mentally or with checklist before committing
- Include lint report in PR description
- Reviewer verifies lint during review

### For AI Agents
- Declare change-type before modification
- Run lint checks after modification
- Include lint report in response
- Self-block if hard gate fails

### For CI/CD (Future)
